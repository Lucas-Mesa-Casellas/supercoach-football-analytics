# 🏟️ SuperCoach — AI Football Analytics System

SuperCoach is an AI-powered system designed to analyze football matches through video,  
providing tactical insights, player recommendations, and performance feedback — like a **personal AI coach**.

## 🎯 Objective
Give players and coaches **real-time and post-match insights**:
- Player tracking & movement heatmaps  
- Tactical shape analysis (pressing, compactness, spacing)  
- Event detection (passes, shots, runs, transitions)  
- Player performance metrics  
- AI recommendations to improve decision-making  

## 🧠 Technology
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- YOLOv8 / YOLOv11 for player detection  
- DeepSORT for player tracking  
- Football metrics (xT, pitch control, pressing intensity)  
- Keypoint detection for player posture (optional)  

## 🚀 Roadmap
### Phase 1 — Foundations (Dec 2025)
- [ ] Video → Player Detection (YOLO)  
- [ ] Player Tracking (DeepSORT)  
- [ ] Assign jersey numbers  
- [ ] Pitch calibration  

### Phase 2 — Tactical Intelligence (Jan–Feb 2026)
- [ ] Compute heatmaps, sprint zones  
- [ ] Team shape detection (4-4-2, 4-3-3, etc.)  
- [ ] Pressing intensity (PPDA)  
- [ ] Dangerous areas + Expected Threat (xT)  
- [ ] Ball tracking  

### Phase 3 — Coaching Insights (March 2026)
- [ ] Player advice ("improve positioning on defensive transitions")  
- [ ] Tactical notes ("the team loses compactness in minute 60–75")  
- [ ] Automated report generation (PDF)
